This app has a login page that uses a token so, user has to enter the credentials first. User can access 5 devices and their information on the '/equipments' page. There is a Map page that shows the location of these devices. This Map page was made using Leaflet and React Leaflet. You can access it by going to '/map'. Design was done using Chakra UI.

When starting the program you have to first go into 'http://localhost:3000/login'. The app starts from there.

Use npm install and npm start to use the app.
